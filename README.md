## How would you describe the role of Java programs in the process of creating new technology solutions?


Java programs are like tools for creating new things. They let us bring ideas to life and solve problems. With Java, we can build all kinds of cool stuff, making the world better and more exciting.
Main() Method in java.


Entry Point: The main method serves as the entry point for Java programs. It's where the execution of the program begins.
Signature: The main method has a specific signature: public static void main(String[] args). This signature is required for Java to recognize it as the starting point of the program.
Arguments: The args parameter allows the main method to receive command-line arguments when the program is executed. These arguments can be used to provide input or configuration to the program.
Static: The main method is declared as static, meaning it belongs to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. This allows it to be called without creating an object of the class.
Execution: Code inside the main method is executed sequentially, starting from the first statement and continuing until the end of the method. It typically contains the logic to be executed when the program runs, such as initializing variables, invoking methods, and controlling program flow.




public static void main(String args[])  //static method  
{  
// your code
}



public: It is an access specifier. We should use a public keyword before the main() method so that JVM can identify the execution point of the program. If we use private, protected, and default before the main() method, it will not be visible to JVM.

static: You can make a method static by using the keyword static. We should call the main() method without creating an object. Static methods are the method which invokes without creating the objects, so we do not need any object to call the main() method.

void: In Java, every method has the return type. Void keyword acknowledges the compiler that main() method does not return any value.

main(): It is a default signature which is predefined in the JVM. It is called by JVM to execute a program line by line and end the execution after completion of this method. We can also overload the main() method.

String args[]: The main() method also accepts some data from the user. It accepts a group of strings, which is called a string array. It is used to hold the command line arguments in the form of string values.
